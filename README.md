# Shopify Product Swiper Gallery with Color Filtering and Dynamic Dropdown
## Overview üîß
This project showcases a flexible and responsive product gallery for Shopify stores. Built with Swiper.js, it allows merchants to control the gallery layout for different screen sizes and dynamically filter product images based on selected color variants. It also features a customizable dropdown, sourced directly from product metafields, making it easy to extend product pages without touching the code.

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- In the current implementation, the gallery includes a check using variantImages[initialVariantName] to ensure that products with a single image are displayed in full-screen mode. This enhancement provides an optimal viewing experience for single-image products, though it requires proper CSS styling to fully realize the full-screen effect.
